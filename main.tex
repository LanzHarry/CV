\section*{Experience}
\hrule

\textbf{PhD:}

\begin{itemize}
  % \item Designed and maintained end-to-end software systems in Python and \cpp supporting a custom MRI system, spanning data acquisition, processing, visualisation, and hardware control.
  \item Owned and evolved a production-grade backend software stack (Python, C++) supporting a custom MRI platform, used daily by researchers and clinicians.
  \item Designed data pipelines processing large 3D datasets with strict correctness, performance, and reproducibility requirements.
  \item Built long-running services for hardware coordination, including state machines, fault handling, structured logging, and safety interlocks.
  \item Made trade-offs between performance, complexity, and usability in collaboration with non-engineering stakeholders.
  \item Experience reasoning about distributed systems concerns: partial failure, retries, idempotency, ordering, and observability in multi-process systems.
  \item Reduced end-to-end data processing latency by \(\sim10\times\), transforming a batch workflow into an interactive system integrated directly into a user-facing analysis tool.
  \item Replaced multiple manual pipeline stages with fully automated, fault-tolerant implementations, enabling first-in-human testing of a new MRI scanner with surgical correlation of results.


\end{itemize}

\textbf{Master's project:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extended a large Fortran-based CFD codebase to support new numerical analysis methods for identifying chaotic turbulent flow regions.
  \item Worked within an existing production codebase, adding functionality without breaking established workflows.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aeronautics high performance computing:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented a parallel \cpp solver for fluid dynamics simulations using domain decomposition and deployed it on a shared HPC cluster environment using MPI.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mindbridge:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a Python-based data ingestion tool to digitise handwritten questionnaire responses from scanned documents into a CSV.
  \item Built a PyQt GUI workflow enabling human validation of ambiguous entries before export to CSV for downstream analysis.
\end{itemize}
