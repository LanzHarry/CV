\section*{Experience}
\hrule

\textbf{PhD:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and maintained end-to-end software systems in Python and \cpp supporting a custom MRI scanner, spanning data acquisition, processing, visualisation, and hardware control.
  \item Developed data processing and image analysis pipelines in Python (NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch) and Matlab, handling large 3D imaging datasets.
  \item Implemented hardware control and GUI software in \cpp to coordinate scanner motion via CANbus, including logging and safety checks.
  \item Built interactive visualisation and segmentation tools to support non-technical users and downstream analysis.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Master's project:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extended a large Fortran-based CFD codebase to support new numerical analysis methods for identifying chaotic turbulent flow regions.
  \item Worked within an existing production codebase, adding functionality without breaking established workflows.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aeronautics high performance computing:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented a parallel \cpp solver for fluid dynamics simulations using domain decomposition and deployed it on a shared HPC cluster environment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mindbridge:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a Python-based data ingestion tool to digitise handwritten questionnaire responses from scanned documents into a CSV.
  \item Built a PyQt GUI workflow enabling human validation of ambiguous entries before export to CSV for downstream analysis.
\end{itemize}
