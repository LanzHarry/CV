\section*{Experience}
\hrule

\textbf{PhD:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Primary engineer responsible for the design, implementation, and long-term maintenance of multiple production software systems.
  
  \item Owned and evolved a production-grade backend software stack (Python, \cpp) supporting a custom MRI platform used daily by researchers and clinicians.
  
  \item Reduced end-to-end data processing latency by a factor of 10, transforming an offline batch workflow into an interactive, user-facing analysis tool.
  
  \item Replaced multiple manual pipeline stages with fully automated, fault-tolerant implementations, directly enabling first-in-human testing with surgical correlation of results.
  
  \item Designed and maintained data pipelines processing large 3D datasets with strict correctness, performance, and reproducibility requirements.
  
  \item Built long-running services for hardware coordination, including state machines, structured logging, validation checks, and defensive error handling.
  
  \item Acted as the primary point of contact for debugging, failure investigation, and behavioural changes in production systems.
  
  \item Collaborated closely with non-engineering stakeholders to translate ambiguous requirements into robust technical solutions.
  
  \item Mentored and onboarded Master's students contributing to production codebases, providing design guidance, code reviews, and debugging support.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Master's project:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked within an existing production codebase, adding functionality whilst respecting established workflows.
  \item Extended a large Fortran-based CFD codebase to support new numerical analysis methods for identifying chaotic turbulent flow regions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aeronautics high performance computing:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented a parallel \cpp solver for fluid dynamics simulations using domain decomposition and deployed it on a shared HPC cluster environment using MPI.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mindbridge:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a Python-based data ingestion tool to digitise handwritten questionnaire responses from scanned documents into a CSV.
  \item Built a PyQt GUI workflow enabling human validation of ambiguous entries before export to CSV for downstream analysis.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\textbf{Personal Projects:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed embedded \cpp applications on ESP32 involving networked device control over TCP/IP and REST interfaces; implemented request handling, state management, and failure recovery.
  \item Experience operating Linux services on Raspberry Pi including VPN, DNS, and media servers, deployed using Docker and Docker Compose; configured networking, port forwarding, and service isolation.
\end{itemize}
