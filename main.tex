{\bf Junior Software Engineer (backend/full stack) with experience building production-grade data pipelines, optimisation and analysis algorithms, and hardware control software during my PhD. Experienced in Python and \cpp, with strong fundamentals in Linux, Git, SQL, and Docker.} \\ \vspace{-0.2cm} \hrule

\section*{Experience}
\hrule

\textbf{PhD:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I developed the full tech stack for my research group during my PhD. This included image analysis algorithms in Python and Matlab, MRI scanner motion control software in \cpp (logic and GUI) over CANbus, image reconstruction algorithms in Python using PyTorch, data pipelines, and image segmentation and data visualisation GUIs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Master's Project:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I implemented new functionality for an in-house computational fluid dynamics solver in Fortran to allow analysis of regions of chaotic turbulent mixing using Covariant Lyapunov Vectors.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{High Performance Computing (HPC):}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I developed a parallelised computational fluid dynamics solver in \cpp to run on the Imperial College London HPC supercomputer. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mindbridge:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item During a project for Mindbridge that required data collection via paper questionnaires I developed a data entry GUI in Python to automatically populate a csv with data from scanned paper questionnaires with human validation for ambiguous entries. 
\end{itemize}
